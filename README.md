# Obstacle_Avoidance


![Simulation Screenshot](obstacle_avoidance.png)


This repository contains Python code for simulating a robot that performs obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.

## Contents

- `main.py`: This file contains the main code for simulating the robot and obstacle avoidance.
- `Robot.py`: This file contains the implementation of the Robot class and related functionalities such as movement and obstacle avoidance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library using pip:  `pip install pygame`
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the repository directory.
5. Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`
6. The simulation window will open, showing the robot navigating through the environment and avoiding obstacles.

## Usage

The `main.py` file initializes the simulation environment, creates a robot instance, and controls the main loop of the simulation. The `Robot.py` file contains the implementation of the Robot class, which includes methods for movement and obstacle avoidance.
